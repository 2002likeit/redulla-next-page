        <p>Gol D. Roger, aka the "Pirate King," was a notorious sailor who dominated the Grand Line. 
            The World Government's capture and subsequent execution of him caused a paradigm shift, as his famous last words revealed the existence of the world's most valuable treasure – One Piece.
            This sparked the Grand Age of Pirates, with a new generation of seafarers seeking the treasure and the esteemed title of Pirate King. Amidst this new era, Monkey D. Luffy stands out as an unconventional pirate. 
            He isn't interested in the typical pirate life of violence and plunder. Instead, he craves adventure and excitement – discovering new places, meeting unique characters, and ultimately finding the legendary treasure. 
            Luffy and his crew set sail across the Grand Line, facing incredible challenges, solving cryptic puzzles, and battling powerful adversaries to uncover the coveted One Piece.</p>

        <p>"The right death" is what a boy fights for in the midst of the curses that plague our daily lives.
            These curses are born from negative emotions like hardship, regret, and shame, and they can wreak havoc on people's lives, often resulting in death.
            Ironically, the only way to banish these curses is by invoking another curse.
            Itadori Yuji is an average high schooler with extraordinary physical abilities.
            But when he consumes the finger of the Double-Faced Specter to save a friend from the Curses' wrath, he unwittingly makes himself a host to the curse. 
            Itadori shares a body with the Double-Faced Specter, and under the guidance of the powerful sorcerer Gojou Satoru, he enrolls in the Tokyo Metropolitan Technical High School of Sorcery. 
            There, he joins an organization committed to battling the Curses, and embarks on a heroic quest to exorcise the curse he carries. 
            But this quest comes at a steep price, for Itadori has become a curse himself, trapped in a life without any possibility of turning back.</p>
